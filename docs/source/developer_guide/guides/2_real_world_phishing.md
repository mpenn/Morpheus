# 2. A Real-World Application: Phishing Detection

## Data Preprocessing

Now that we've seen a basic example of how to create a stage and use it in the context of a pipeline, we'll move on to a more advanced example that is representative of what we might want to do in a real-world situation. Given a set of records, each of which represents an email, suppose we want to predict which records correspond to fraudulent emails.

As part of this process, we might want to use a classification model trained on various pieces of metadata, such as recipient count, in addition to the raw content of each email. If we suppose this is true for our example, we need to build and connect a pre-processing stage to attach this information to each record before applying our classifier.

For this task, we'll need to define a new stage, which we will call our `RecipientFeaturesStage`, that will:
1. Receive an input corresponding to an email.
1. Count the number of recipients in the email's metadata.
1. Construct a Morpheus `MessageMeta` object that will contain the record content along with the augmented metadata.

For this stage, the code will look very similar to the previous example with a few notable changes. We will be working with the `MessageMeta` class. This is a Morpheus message containing a [cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/) [DataFrame](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/api_docs/dataframe.html). Since we will expect our new stage to operate on {py:obj}`~morpheus.pipeline.messages.MessageMeta` types, our new `accepted_types` method now looks like:

```python
def accepted_types(self) -> typing.Tuple:
    return (MessageMeta,)
```

Next, we will update our `on_data` method to perform the actual work.
We grab a reference to the incoming message's `df` attribute. It is important to note that `message` is a reference, and any changes made to it or its members (such as `df`) will be performed in place on the existing message instance.

```python
def on_data(self, message: MessageMeta) -> MessageMeta:
    # Get the DataFrame from the incoming message
    df = message.df

    df['to_count'] = df['To'].str.count('@')
    df['bcc_count'] = df['BCC'].str.count('@')
    df['cc_count'] = df['CC'].str.count('@')
    df['total_recipients'] = df['to_count'] + df['bcc_count'] + df['cc_count']

    # Attach features to string data
    df['data'] = (df['to_count'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' +
                    df['bcc_count'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' +
                    df['cc_count'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' +
                    df['total_recipients'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' +
                    df['Message'])

    # Return the message for the next stage
    return message
```

If mutating the data frame is undesirable, we could make a call to the data frame's [copy](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/api_docs/api/cudf.DataFrame.copy.html#cudf.DataFrame.copy) method and return a new `MessageMeta`. Note however that this would come at the cost of performance and increased memory usage. Our updated `on_data` method would look like this (changing the first and last lines of the method):

```python
def on_data(self, message: MessageMeta) -> MessageMeta:
    # Take a copy of the DataFrame from the incoming message
    df = message.df.copy(True)
    ...
    # Construct and return a new message containing our DataFrame
    return MessageMeta(df=df)
```


Our `_build_single` method remains unchanged; even though we are modifying the incoming messages, our input and output types remain the same.

### The Completed Preprocessing Stage

```python
import typing

import srf

from morpheus.messages.message_meta import MessageMeta
from morpheus.pipeline.single_port_stage import SinglePortStage
from morpheus.pipeline.stream_pair import StreamPair


class RecipientFeaturesStage(SinglePortStage):

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "recipient-features"

    def accepted_types(self) -> typing.Tuple:
        return (MessageMeta, )

    def supports_cpp_node(self) -> bool:
        return False

    def on_data(self, message: MessageMeta) -> MessageMeta:
        # Get the DataFrame from the incoming message
        df = message.df

        df['to_count'] = df['To'].str.count('@')
        df['bcc_count'] = df['BCC'].str.count('@')
        df['cc_count'] = df['CC'].str.count('@')
        df['total_recipients'] = df['to_count'] + df['bcc_count'] + df['cc_count']

        # Attach features to string data
        df['data'] = (df['to_count'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' + df['bcc_count'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' +
                      df['cc_count'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' + df['total_recipients'].astype(str) + '[SEP]' +
                      df['Message'])

        # Return the message for the next stage
        return message

    def _build_single(self, builder: srf.Builder, input_stream: StreamPair) -> StreamPair:
        node = builder.make_node(self.unique_name, self.on_data)
        builder.make_edge(input_stream[0], node)

        return node, input_stream[1]
```

### Testing the Preprocessing Stage

To test our new stage, we will modify the pipeline from the previous guide by replacing the pass through stage with our new one.
To do this, just update these lines from the previous guide:

```python
# Add our own stage
pipeline.add_stage(PassThruStage(config))

# Add monitor to record the performance of our new stage
pipeline.add_stage(MonitorStage(config))
```

To:

```python
# Add our own stage
pipeline.add_stage(RecipientFeaturesStage(config))

# Add monitor to record the performance of our new stage
pipeline.add_stage(MonitorStage(config))
```

## Predicting Fraudulent Emails with Accelerated Machine Learning

Now we'll use the `RecipientFeaturesStage` that we just made in a real-world pipeline to detect fraudulent emails. The pipeline we will be building makes use of the `TritonInferenceStage` which is a pre-defined Morpheus stage designed to support the execution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models via NVIDIA's [Triton Inference Server framework](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server). NVIDIA Triton Inference Server allows for GPU accelerated ML/DL and seamless co-location and execution of a wide variety of model frameworks. For our application, we will be using the `phishing-bert-onnx` model, which is included with Morpheus in the `models/triton-model-repo/` directory.

It's important to note here that Triton is a service that is external to the Morpheus pipeline and often will not reside on the same machine(s) as the rest of the pipeline. The `TritonInferenceStage` will use HTTP and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) network protocols to allow us to interact with the machine learning models that are hosted by the Triton server.

### Launching Triton

Triton will need to be running while we execute our pipeline. For simplicity, we will launch it locally inside of a Docker container.

Note: This step assumes you have both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and the [Nvidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#installation-guide) installed.

From the root of the Morpheus project we will launch a Triton Docker container with the `models` directory mounted into the container:

```shell
docker run --rm -ti --gpus=all -p8000:8000 -p8001:8001 -p8002:8002 -v $PWD/models:/models nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:22.02-py3 tritonserver --model-repository=/models/triton-model-repo --exit-on-error=false --log-info=true
```

Once we have Triton running, we can verify that it is healthy using [curl](https://curl.se/). The `/v2/health/live` endpoint should return a 200 status code:

```shell
curl -v "localhost:8000/v2/health/live"
```

We can also query Triton for the available models:

```shell
curl -X POST "localhost:8000/v2/repository/index"
```

Let's ask Triton for some information about the `phishing-bert-onnx` model which we are going to be using:

```shell
curl "localhost:8000/v2/models/phishing-bert-onnx/config"
```

Output:
```
{"name":"phishing-bert-onnx","versions":["1"],"platform":"onnxruntime_onnx","inputs":[{"name":"input_ids","datatype":"INT64","shape":[-1,128]},{"name":"attention_mask","datatype":"INT64","shape":[-1,128]}],"outputs":[{"name":"output","datatype":"FP32","shape":[-1,2]}]}
```

From this information, we can see that the expected shape of the model inputs is `"shape":[-1,128]}`.

### Defining our Pipeline
Let's set up the paths for our input and output files. For simplicity, we assume that the `MORPHEUS_ROOT` environment variable is set to the root of the Morpheus project repository. In a production deployment, it may be more prudent to replace our usage of environment variables with command-line flags or a dedicated configuration management library.

```python
import os

import morpheus

root_dir = os.environ['MORPHEUS_ROOT']
out_dir = os.environ.get('OUT_DIR', '/tmp')

labels_file = os.path.join(morpheus.DATA_DIR, 'labels_phishing.txt')
vocab_file = os.path.join(morpheus.DATA_DIR, 'bert-base-uncased-hash.txt')

input_file = os.path.join(root_dir, 'examples/data/email_with_addresses.jsonlines')
results_file = os.path.join(out_dir, 'detections.jsonlines')
```

To start, we will need to instantiate and set a few members of the `Config` class. This object is used for configuration options that are global to the pipeline as a whole. We will provide this object to each stage along with stage-specific configuration parameters.

```python
config = Config()
config.mode = PipelineModes.NLP

config.num_threads = os.cpu_count()
config.feature_length = 128

with open(labels_file) as fh:
    config.class_labels = [x.strip() for x in fh]
```

First we set our pipeline mode to NLP. Next, we set the `num_threads` property to match the number of cores in our system.

The `feature_length` property needs to match the length of the model inputs, which we got from Triton in the previous section using the model's `/config` endpoint.

Ground truth classification labels are read from the `morpheus/data/labels_phishing.txt` file included in Morpheus.

Now that our config object is populated, we move on to the pipeline itself. We will be using the same input file from the previous examples, and to tokenize the input data we will use Morpheus' `PreprocessNLPStage`.

This stage uses the [cudf subword tokenizer](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/api_docs/api/cudf.core.subword_tokenizer.SubwordTokenizer.__call__.html) to transform strings into a tensor of numbers to be fed into the neural network model. Rather than split the string by characters or whitespaces, we split them into meaningful subwords based upon the occurrence of the subwords in a large training corpus. You can find more details here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v2). All we need to know for now is that the text will be converted to subword token ids based on the vocabulary file that we provide (`vocab_hash_file=vocab file`).

Let's go ahead and instantiate our `PreprocessNLPStage` and add it to the pipeline:

```python
pipeline.add_stage(
    PreprocessNLPStage(
        config,
        vocab_hash_file=vocab_file,
        truncation=True,
        do_lower_case=True,
        add_special_tokens=False))
```

In addition to providing the `Config` object that we defined above, we also configure this stage to:
* Use the `morpheus/data/bert-base-uncased-hash.txt` vocabulary file for its subword token ids (`vocab_hash_file=vocab_file`).
* Truncate the length of the text to a max number of tokens (`truncation=True`).
* Change the casing to all lowercase (`do_lower_case=True`).
* Refrain from adding the default BERT special tokens like `[SEP]` for separation between two sentences and `[CLS]` at the start of the text (`add_special_tokens=False`).

Note that the tokenizer parameters and vocabulary hash file should exactly match what was used for tokenization during the training of the NLP model.

At this point, we have a pipeline that reads in a set of records and preprocesses them with the metadata required for our classifier to make predictions. Our next step is to define a stage that applies a machine learning model to our `MessageMeta` object. To accomplish this, we will be using Morpheus' `TritonInferenceStage` class. This class will handle communication with the `phishing-bert-onnx` model, which we provided to the Triton Docker container via the `models` directory mount.

Next we will add a monitor stage to measure the inference rate as well as a filter stage to filter out any results below a probability threshold of `0.9`.
```python
# Add an inference stage
pipeline.add_stage(
    TritonInferenceStage(
        config,
        model_name='phishing-bert-onnx',
        server_url=triton_url,
        force_convert_inputs=True,
    ))

pipeline.add_stage(MonitorStage(config, description="Inference Rate", smoothing=0.001, unit="inf"))

# Filter values lower than 0.9
pipeline.add_stage(FilterDetectionsStage(config, threshold=0.9))
```

Lastly, we will save our results to disk. For this purpose, we are using two stages that are often used in conjunction with each other: `SerializeStage` and `WriteToFileStage`.

The `SerializeStage` is used to include and exclude columns as desired in the output. Importantly, it also handles conversion from the `MultiMessage`-derived output type that is used by the `FilterDetectionsStage` to the `MessageMeta` class that is expected as input by the `WriteToFileStage`.

The `WriteToFileStage` will append message data to the output file as messages are received. Note however that for performance reasons the `WriteToFileStage` does not flush its contents out to disk every time a message is received. Instead, it relies on the underlying [buffered output stream](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/streambufs.html) to flush as needed, and then will close the file handle on shutdown.

```python
# Write the file to the output
pipeline.add_stage(SerializeStage(config))
pipeline.add_stage(WriteToFileStage(config, filename=results_file, overwrite=True))
```

Note that we didn't specify the output format. In our example, the result file contains the extension `.jsonlines`. Morpheus will infer the output format based on the extension. At time of writing the extensions that Morpheus will infer are: `.csv`, `.json` & `.jsonlines`

To explicitly set the output format we could specify the `file_type` argument to the `WriteToFileStage` which is an enumeration defined in `morpheus._lib.file_types.FileTypes`. Current values defined are:
* `FileTypes.Auto`
* `FileTypes.JSON`
* `FileTypes.CSV`

    # Run the pipeline
    pipeline.run()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_pipeline()
```

## Stage Constructors

In our previous examples, we didn't define a constructor for the Python classes that we were building for our stages. However, there are many cases where we will need to receive configuration parameters. Every stage constructor must receive an instance of a `morpheus.config.Config` object as its first argument and is then free to define additional stage-specific arguments after that. The Morpheus config object will contain configuration parameters needed by multiple stages in the pipeline, and the constructor in each Morpheus stage is free to inspect these. In contrast, parameters specific to a single stage are typically defined as constructor arguments.

Note that it is a best practice to perform any necessary validation checks in the constructor. This allows us to fail early rather than after the pipeline has started.

In our `RecipientFeaturesStage` example, we hard-coded the Bert separator token. Let's instead refactor the code to receive that as a constructor argument. Let's also take the opportunity to verify that the pipeline mode is set to `morpheus.config.PipelineModes.NLP`. Our refactored class definition now looks like:

```python
class RecipientFeaturesStage(SinglePortStage):
    def __init__(self,
                 config: Config,
                 sep_token: str='[SEP]'):
        super().__init__(config)
        if config.mode != PipelineModes.NLP:
            raise RuntimeError("RecipientFeaturesStage must be used in a pipeline configured for NLP")

        if len(sep_token):
            self._sep_token = sep_token
        else:
            raise ValueError("sep_token cannot be an empty string")
```

## Defining a New Source Stage

Creating a new source stage is similar to defining any other stage with a few differences. First, we will be subclassing `SingleOutputSource`. Second, the required methods are just the `name` property method and the `_build_source` method.

In this example, we will create a source that reads messages from a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) queue using the [pika](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) client for Python. For simplicity, we will assume that authentication is not required for our RabbitMQ exchange and that the body of the RabbitMQ messages will be JSON formatted. Both authentication and support for other formats could be easily added later.

The `_build_source` method is similar to the `_build_single` method; it receives an instance of the pipeline segment and returns a `StreamPair`. However, unlike in the previous examples, source stages do not have parent stages and therefore do not receive a `StreamPair` as input. We also will no longer build our node by calling `make_node`. Instead, we will call `make_source` with the parameter `self.source_generator`, which is a method that we will define next.

```python
def _build_source(self, builder: srf.Builder) -> StreamPair:
    node = builder.make_source(self.unique_name, self.source_generator)
    return node, MessageMeta
```

The `source_generator` method is where most of the RabbitMQ-specific code exists. Source node methods receive an instance of `srf.Subscriber` as their first argument. When we have a message that we wish to emit into the pipeline, we call the `srf.Subscriber.on_next` method.

```python
def source_generator(self, subscriber: srf.Subscriber):
    try:
        while subscriber.is_subscribed():
            (method_frame, header_frame, body) = self._channel.basic_get(self._queue_name)
            if method_frame is not None:
                try:
                    buffer = StringIO(body.decode("utf-8"))
                    df = cudf.io.read_json(buffer, orient='records', lines=True)
                    subscriber.on_next(MessageMeta(df=df))
                except Exception as ex:
                    logger.exception("Error occurred converting RabbitMQ message to Dataframe: {}".format(ex))
                finally:
                    self._channel.basic_ack(method_frame.delivery_tag)
            else:
                # queue is empty, sleep before polling again
                time.sleep(self._poll_interval.total_seconds())

    finally:
        self._connection.close()
```

Note that we read messages as quickly as we can from the queue. When the queue is empty we call `time.sleep`, allowing for a context switch to occur if needed.

Note also that we acknowledge the message (by calling `basic_ack`) only once we have successfully emitted the message (via `on_next`) or failed to deserialize the message. This means that if the pipeline shuts down while consuming the queue, we will not lose any messages. However, in that situation we may end up with a duplicate message (i.e., if the pipeline is shut down after we have called `on_next` but before calling `basic_ack`).

## Defining a New Sink Stage

In Morpheus, we define a stage to be a sink if it outputs the results of a pipeline to a destination external to the pipeline. Morpheus currently provides two sink stages:  `WriteToFileStage` and `WriteToKafkaStage`.

Recall that in the previous section we wrote a `RabbitMQSourceStage`. We will now complement that by writing a sink stage that can output Morpheus data into RabbitMQ. For this example, we are again using the [pika](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) client for Python.

The code for our sink will look similar to other stages with a few changes. First, we will subclass `SinglePortStage`:

```python
class WriteToRabbitMQStage(SinglePortStage):
```

In our `_build_single` we will be making use of the `make_sink` method rather than `make_node` or `make_source`
```python
def _build_single(self, builder: srf.Builder, input_stream: StreamPair) -> StreamPair:
    node = builder.make_sink(self.unique_name, self.on_data, self.on_error, self.on_complete)
    builder.make_edge(input_stream[0], node)
    return input_stream
```

Note that in this case, while we created an edge from the parent node to our new node, we returned the `input_stream` unchanged. This allows for other sinks to be attached to our same parent node. We could hypothetically have a pipeline where we emit the results to both RabbitMQ and a file. In this situation, both would be children of the same upstream node.

![Morpheus node dependency diagram](img/sink_deps.png)

Similar to our previous examples, most of the actual business logic of the stage is contained in the `on_data` method. In this case, we grab a reference to the [cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/) [DataFrame](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/api_docs/dataframe.html) attached to the incoming message. We then serialize to an [io.StringIO](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/io.html?highlight=stringio#io.StringIO) buffer, which is then sent to RabbitMQ.

```python
def on_data(self, message: MessageMeta):
    df = message.df
    buffer = StringIO()
    df.to_json(buffer, orient='records', lines=True)
    body = buffer.getvalue().strip()
    self._channel.basic_publish(exchange=self._exchange, routing_key=self._routing_key, body=body)
    return message
```

The two new methods introduced in this example are the `on_error` and `on_complete` methods. For both methods, we want to make sure that the [connection](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/connection.html) object is properly closed.
Note: we didn't close the channel object since closing the connection will also close any associated channel objects.

```python
def on_error(self, ex: Exception):
    logger.exception("Error occurred : {}".format(ex))
    self._connection.close()

def on_complete(self):
    self._connection.close()
```
