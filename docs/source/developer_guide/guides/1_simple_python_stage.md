# 1. A Simple Python Stage

## Background

Morpheus makes use of the SRF graph-execution framework. Morpheus pipelines are built on top of SRF pipelines. Pipelines in SRF are made up of segments; however, in many common cases, a SRF pipeline will consist of only a single segment. Our Morpheus stages will interact with the SRF segment to build nodes and add them to the SRF graph. In the common case, a Morpheus stage will add a single node to the graph, but in some cases it will add multiple nodes to the graph.

## The Pass Through Stage

To start, we will implement a single stage that could be included in a pipeline. For illustration, this stage will do nothing but take the input from the previous stage and forward it to the next stage. All Morpheus stages have several things in common, so while this doesn't do too much, it ends up being a good starting point for writing a new stage. From there, we can add our functionality as needed.

Defining this stage requires us to specify the stage type. Morpheus stages contain a single input and a single output inherited from `SinglePortStage`.  Stages that act as sources of data, in that they do not take an input from a prior stage but rather produce data from a source such as a file, Kafka service, or other external sources, will need to inherit from the `SingleOutputSource` base class.  We start our class definition with a few basic imports:

```python
import typing

import srf

from morpheus.pipeline.single_port_stage import SinglePortStage
from morpheus.pipeline.stream_pair import StreamPair

class PassThruStage(SinglePortStage):
```

There are four methods that need to be defined in our new subclass to implement the stage interface: `name`, `accepted_types`, `supports_cpp_node`, and `_build_single`. In practice, it is often necessary to define at least one more method which will perform the actual work of the stage; by convention, this method is typically named `on_data`, which we will define in our examples.

`name` is a property method; it should return a user-friendly name for the stage. Currently, this property is only used for debugging purposes, and there are no requirements on the content or format of the name.
```python
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "pass-thru"
```

The `accepted_types` method returns a tuple of message classes that this stage accepts as valid inputs. Morpheus uses this to validate that the parent of this stage emits a message that this stage can accept. Since our stage is a pass through, we will declare that we can accept any incoming message type. Note that production stages will often declare only a single Morpheus message class such as `MessageMeta` or `MultiMessage` (see the message classes defined in `morpheus.pipeline.messages` for a complete list).
```python
    def accepted_types(self) -> typing.Tuple:
        return (typing.Any,)
```

The `supports_cpp_node` method returns a boolean indicating if the stage has a C++ implementation. Since our example only contains a Python implementation we will return `False` here.
```python
    def supports_cpp_node(self) -> bool:
        return False
```

Our `on_data` method accepts the incoming message and returns a message. The returned message can be the same message instance that we received as our input or it could be a new message instance. The method is named `on_data` by convention; however, it is not part of the API. In the next section, we will register it as a callback in Morpheus.
```python
    def on_data(self, message: typing.Any):
        # Return the message for the next stage
        return message
```

Finally, the `_build_single` method will be used at build time to wire our stage into the pipeline. `_build_single` receives an instance of the SRF pipeline segment along with a `StreamPair` instance. We will be using the segment instance to build a node from our stage and add it to the pipeline segment. The `StreamPair` argument is a tuple; the first element is our parent node, and the second is our parent node's output type. The return type of this method is also a `StreamPair`. Typically, we will be returning our newly constructed node along with our output type.
```python
    def _build_single(self, builder: srf.Builder, input_stream: StreamPair) -> StreamPair:
        node = builder.make_node(self.unique_name, self.on_data)
        builder.make_edge(input_stream[0], node)
```

In most cases, a Morpheus stage will define and build a single SRF node. In some advanced cases, a stage can construct more than one node. For our purposes, a Morpheus _stage_ defines information about the type of node(s) it builds, while the _node_ is the instance of the stage that is wired into the SRF pipeline. To build the node, we will call the `make_node` method of the segment instance, passing to it our name and our `on_data` method. We used the `unique_name` property, which will take the name property which we already defined and append a unique id to it.
```python
node = builder.make_node(self.unique_name, self.on_data)
```

Next, we will define an edge connecting our new node to our parent node:
```python
builder.make_edge(input_stream[0], node)
```

Finally, we will return a new tuple of our node and output type. Since this is a pass through node that can accept any input type, we will return our parent's type.
```python
return node, input_stream[1]
```

## Putting the Stage Together
```python
import typing

import srf

from morpheus.pipeline.single_port_stage import SinglePortStage
from morpheus.pipeline.stream_pair import StreamPair


class PassThruStage(SinglePortStage):

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "pass-thru"

    def accepted_types(self) -> typing.Tuple:
        return (typing.Any, )

    def supports_cpp_node(self) -> bool:
        return False

    def on_data(self, message: typing.Any):
        # Return the message for the next stage
        return message

    def _build_single(self, builder: srf.Builder, input_stream: StreamPair) -> StreamPair:
        node = builder.make_node(self.unique_name, self.on_data)
        builder.make_edge(input_stream[0], node)

        return node, input_stream[1]
```

## Testing our new Stage
To start testing our new pass through stage, we are going to construct a simple pipeline and add our new stage to it. This pipeline will do the minimum work necessary to verify our pass through stage. Data will flow through our simple pipeline as follows:
1. A source stage will produce data and inject it into the pipeline.
1. This data will be read and processed by our pass through stage, in this case simply forwarding on the data.
1. A monitoring stage will record the messages from our pass through stage and terminate the pipeline.

First we will need to import a few things from Morpheus for this example to work. Note that this test script, which we will name "run_passthru.py", assumes that we saved the code for the PassThruStage in a file named "pass_thru.py" in the same directory.
```python
import logging
import os

from morpheus.config import Config
from morpheus.pipeline import LinearPipeline
from morpheus.stages.general.monitor_stage import MonitorStage
from morpheus.stages.input.file_source_stage import FileSourceStage
from morpheus.utils.logger import configure_logging

from pass_thru import PassThruStage
```

Before constructing the pipeline, we need to do a bit of environment configuration, starting with the Morpheus logger:
```python
configure_logging(log_level=logging.DEBUG)
```

Next, we will build a Morpheus `Config` object. We will cover setting some common configuration parameters in the next guide. For now, it is important to know that we will always need to build a `Config` object:
```python
config = Config()
```

In this example, we will use the `FileSourceStage` class to read a large file in which each line is a JSON object that represents an email message. The stage will take these lines and package them as Morpheus message objects for our pass through stage to consume. Let's setup our source stage:
```python
pipeline.set_source(FileSourceStage(config, filename=input_file, iterative=False))
```

Next, we will add our new stage to the pipeline as well as a `MonitorStage` which will measure the throughput of our pass through stage:

```python
pipeline.add_stage(PassThruStage(config))
pipeline.add_stage(MonitorStage(config))
```

Finally, we run the pipeline:
```python
pipeline.run()
```

The output should look like this:
```

## Putting the Pipeline Together
Note that this code assumes the `MORPHEUS_ROOT` environment variable is set to the root of the Morpheus project repository:
```python
import logging
import os

from morpheus.config import Config
from morpheus.pipeline import LinearPipeline
from morpheus.stages.general.monitor_stage import MonitorStage
from morpheus.stages.input.file_source_stage import FileSourceStage
from morpheus.utils.logger import configure_logging

from pass_thru import PassThruStage

def run_pipeline():
    # Enable the Morpheus logger
    configure_logging(log_level=logging.DEBUG)

    root_dir = os.environ['MORPHEUS_ROOT']
    input_file = os.path.join(root_dir, 'examples/data/email_with_addresses.jsonlines')

    config = Config()

    # Create a linear pipeline object
    pipeline = LinearPipeline(config)

    # Set source stage
    pipeline.set_source(FileSourceStage(config, filename=input_file, iterative=False))

    # Add our own stage
    pipeline.add_stage(PassThruStage(config))

    # Add monitor to record the performance of our new stage
    pipeline.add_stage(MonitorStage(config))

    # Run the pipeline
    pipeline.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_pipeline()
```
