/****** FilterDetectionStage********************************/
/**
 * The FilterDetectionsStage is used to filter rows from a dataframe based on values in a tensor using a specified
 * criteria. Rows in the `meta` dataframe are excluded if their associated value in the `probs` array is less than or
 * equal to `threshold`.
 *
 * This stage can operate in two different modes set by the `copy` argument.
 * When the `copy` argument is `true` (default), rows that meet the filter criteria are copied into a new dataframe.
 * When `false` sliced views are used instead.
 *
 * Setting `copy=true` should be used when the number of matching records is expected to be both high and in
 * non-adjacent rows. In this mode, the stage will generate only one output message for each incoming message,
 * regardless of the size of the input and the number of matching records. However this comes at the cost of needing to
 * allocate additional memory and perform the copy.
 * Note: In most other stages, messages emitted contain a reference to the original `MessageMeta` emitted into the
 * pipeline by the source stage. When using copy mode this won't be the case and could cause the original `MessageMeta`
 * to be deallocated after this stage.
 *
 * Setting `copy=false` should be used when either the number of matching records is expected to be very low or are
 * likely to be contained in adjacent rows. In this mode, slices of contiguous blocks of rows are emitted in multiple
 * output messages. Performing a slice is relatively low-cost, however for each incoming message the number of emitted
 * messages could be high (in the worst case scenario as high as half the number of records in the incoming message).
 * Depending on the downstream stages, this can cause performance issues, especially if those stages need to acquire
 * the Python GIL.
