# Example RabbitMQ stages
This example builds upon the `examples/developer_guide/2_2_rabbitmq` example adding a C++ implementation for the `RabbitMQSourceStage`.

This example adds two flags to the `read_simple.py` script. A `--use_cpp` flag which defaults to `True` and a `--num_threads` flag which defaults to the number of cores on the system as returned by `os.cpu_count()`.

## Testing with a RabbitMQ container
Testing can be performed locally with the RabbitMQ supplied docker image from the [RabbitMQ container registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/):
```bash
docker run --rm -it --hostname my-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

The image can be verified with the web management console by opening http://localhost:15672 in a web browser. Enter "guest" for both the username and the password.

## Launch the reader
In a second terminal from the root of the morpheus repo execute:
```bash
python examples/developer_guide/4_rabbitmq_cpp_Stage/read_simple.py
```

This will read from a RabbitMQ exchange named 'logs', and write the results to `/tmp/results.json`.

If no exchange named 'logs' exists in RabbitMQ it will be created.

## Launch the writer
In a third terminal from the root of the morpheus repo execute:
```bash
python examples/developer_guide/4_rabbitmq_cpp_Stage/write_simple.py
```

This will read json data from the `examples/data/email.jsonlines` file and publish the data into the 'logs' RabbitMQ exchange as a single message.

The `write_simple.py` script will exit as soon as the message is written to the queue. The `read_simple.py` script on the otherhand will continue reading from the queue until explicitly shut down with a control-C.
