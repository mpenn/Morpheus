# ABP Detection Example Using Morpheus


## Setup
To run this example, an instance of Triton Inference Server and a sample dataset is required. The following steps will outline how to build and run Trtion with the provided FIL model.

### Triton Inference Server
```bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:22.02-py3
```

##### Deploy Triton Inference Server

Bind the provided `abp-pcap-xgb` directory to the docker container model repo at `/models`.

```bash
# Change directory to the anomalous behavior profiling example folder
cd <MORPHEUS_ROOT>/examples/abp_pcap_detection

# Launch the container
docker run --rm --gpus=all -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 -v $PWD/abp-pcap-xgb:/models/abp-pcap-xgb --name tritonserver nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:22.02-py3 tritonserver --model-repository=/models --exit-on-error=false --model-control-mode=poll --repository-poll-secs=30
```

##### Verify Model Deployment
Once Triton server finishes starting up, it will display the status of all loaded models. Successful deployment of the model will show the following:

```bash
+-----------------------------+---------+--------+
| Model                       | Version | Status |
+-----------------------------+---------+--------+
| abp-pcap-xgb                | 1       | READY  |
+-----------------------------+---------+--------+
```

## ABP Detection Pipeline
Use Morpheus to run the Anomalous Behavior Profiling Detection Pipeline with the pcap data. A pipeline has been configured in `run.py` with several command line options:

```bash
$ python run.py --help
Usage: run.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --num_threads INTEGER RANGE     Number of internal pipeline threads to use
                                  [x>=1]
  --pipeline_batch_size INTEGER RANGE
                                  Internal batch size for the pipeline. Can be
                                  much larger than the model batch size. Also
                                  used for Kafka consumers  [x>=1]
  --model_max_batch_size INTEGER RANGE
                                  Max batch size to use for the model  [x>=1]
  --input_file PATH               Input filepath  [required]
  --output_file TEXT              The path to the file where the inference
                                  output will be saved.
  --model_fea_length INTEGER RANGE
                                  Features length to use for the model  [x>=1]
  --model_name TEXT               The name of the model that is deployed on
                                  Tritonserver
  --iterative                     Iterative mode will emit dataframes one at a
                                  time. Otherwise a list of dataframes is
                                  emitted. Iterative mode is good for
                                  interleaving source stages.
  --server_url TEXT               Tritonserver url  [required]
  --file_type [auto|json|csv]     Indicates what type of file to read.
                                  Specifying 'auto' will determine the file
                                  type from the extension.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

To launch the configured Morpheus pipeline with the sample data that is provided at `<MORPHEUS_ROOT>/data`, run the following:

```bash
python run.py \
	--input_file ../../data/abp_pcap_dump.jsonlines \
	--output_file ./pcap_out.jsonlines \
	--model_name 'abp-pcap-xgb' \
	--server_url localhost:8001
```
Note: Both Morpheus and Trinton Inference Server containers must have access to the same GPUs in order for this example to work.

The pipeline will process the input `pcap_dump.jsonlines` sample data and write it to `pcap_out.jsonlines`.
